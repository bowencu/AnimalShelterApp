# project_e5b3i_o0s8i_r9a5f (Bowen, Haad, Triston)

## Project Summary
Our project models a pet adoption system managed by an animal shelter. This shelter serves clients who can adopt pets staying at the animal shelter. The shelter is just one branch that is owned by a shelter corporation which manages animal shelter branches within a certain region of the country. Moreover, the shelter is associated with an animal hospital which manages the health of the sheltered animals. In the hospital, veterinarians are responsible for administering vaccines for animals at the shelter and performing monthly health-checkups.

### Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, PHP, Oracle, SQL

### Queries
1. Insert
- User can insert into VeterinarianWorkInfo two values: a VETSIN that is valid (i.e. exists in the VeterinarianInfo table), and a HOSPITALADDRESS that is valid (i.e. exists in the AnimalHospital table). If one or both of the entries are invalid foregin keys, the user is alerted in the webpage and with a pop-up message.
- The insert statement has to also effect the tables referred to by the foreign keys.
2. Select
- We choose to let the user select from the AnimalHelpedAdopt2 table.
- User specifies

## Timeline and task breakdown
### Bowen:
- Will work on implementing the operations assigned to him above
### Haad:
- Will work on implementing the operations assigned to him above
### Triston:
- Triston drew the original ER diagram so he knows the most about the entities and relationships, so he will consult the ER diagram to determine which entities are affected by each operation listed above.
- Will write SQL script for create table statements and populating tables with insert statements
